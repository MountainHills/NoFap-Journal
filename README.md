# NoFap Journal

This project is dedicated to those who are fighting their demons, especially addiction, regardless of their circumstance. I appreciate and admire those who always strive to be a better person no matter how slow and ardurous it might seem. I will always cheer for the person who really puts in the effort to make themselves better for themselves and to others.

## Overview

### Description

This project is a simple addiction journal. The journal would display the streak of days where the user remained sober for their demons.

This project was made without the use of frameworks as to better understand how each component interacts with another. I have yet to learn and built with a proper framework that would speed up the creation of this project.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- JSP
- JDBC
- Servlet
- Apache POI
- SimpleCAPTCHA

### What I learned

- Learned more about starting keywords like static.
- Learned more about how objects interact with each other.
- Polished my understanding of the basics of Java
- Increased the speed of my debugging by providing tests
- I learned that I made efficient code. I have yet to optimize and refactor it.
- I made the mistake of not placing proper coments to my code. When I came back after short break, I was confused where to start.
- I made my records incorrectly. I made them static instead of creating their own instance.

### Continued development

- The app should be planned more. I should've created a simpler code prototype version first, then commit to a full blown project.
- An additional reflection page could be added. It's a more active approach to reflect about streaks rather than numbers alone.
- Proper pop-ups or warnings would be greatly appreciated instead of using linking to other pages when errors occur.
- Keeping the login and registration in the same page would give a better experience.
- A CSV file is better than Excel file, so it can support other OS.
- A better understanding of CSS could improve the responsiveness of the application.
- Improvement in design if possible. Making it a more user-friendly and pleasing to the eyes.
- Use a framework to spend less time rather than reinventing the wheel repeatedly. 

I had a lot of great experiences and learning opportunities in the making of this project. I'm looking forward to the next one.
