## Overview

### Description

A short addiction journal without the use of frameworks. As of creating this journal, I haven't learned or made projects using a MVC Framework. I built the journal from scratch taking up more time that I wanted it to.

### Screenshot

TODO: Add pictures of the project once finished.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML

- Servlet
- Apache POI
- SimpleCAPTCHA

### What I learned

TODO: Fill this section once the project is finished.

### Continued development

The app should be planned more. I should've created a simpler code prototype version first, then commit to a full blown project.

TODO: Fill this section once the project is finished. List down key areas you want to work on with your future projects.

I would add additional features to the same application, however I wouldn't do it this time. I would like to make use of a framework so I could spend less time reinventing the wheel. It's not a good practice to make something from sticks when an already robust set of instructions are already made and optimized.

I had a lot of great experiences and learning opportunities in the making of this project. I'm looking forward to the next one.

### Useful resources

TODO: Fill this section up with links and resources that helped you create this project. It will also be helpful for future projects as well. List down the reason why it helped you too!
